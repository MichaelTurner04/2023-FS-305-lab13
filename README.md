# CS 1580 Lab 13
## Topics
This lab primarily covers 2D arrays and multiple files.

## Using IDE
Students are free to make use any Integrated development environment (IDE) of their choice. An IDE is a software application that helps programmers develop software code, build, debug and test their program efficiently.
There are several IDE both online compliers or desktop application that can help students code more efficiently. Particularly,  "Dev C++" is available on appsanywhere. Students can also make use of any compiler of their choice. 

## Using IDE with Git
1. Choose Your IDE:Select any Integrated Development Environment (IDE) that you prefer. IDEs help you code, build, debug, and test your programs efficiently. You can use either online compilers or desktop applications for this purpose.
2. Install Git: If you don't have Git installed on your computer, you need to install it. Git can be easily downloaded and installed from appsanywhere. Follow the installation instructions for your operating system.
3. Clone the Repository:
a. Open the Git terminal or command prompt on your computer.
b. Navigate to the directory where you want to store your project (use the cd command to change directories).
c. Clone the assigned Git repository to your local machine using the following command:
   > ``git clone <repo_url>``
d. Replace <repo_url> with the actual URL of the Git repository you've been assigned.
4. Open the Cloned Repository in Your IDE: Launch your chosen IDE. Use the IDE's "Open Project" or "Open Folder" option to navigate to the directory where you cloned the repository. Select this directory to open your project.
5. Create Your Code File: Inside the opened project in your IDE, create a new code file (e.g., a .cpp file) where you'll write your code. You can usually create a new file from the IDE's menu or toolbar.
6. Start Coding: Begin writing your code in the newly created file using the features and tools provided by your IDE.
7. Save Your Work: Save your code file regularly as you make progress to ensure you don't lose your work.
8. Submission Instructions (Using Git): After you've completed your code and are ready to submit it, follow the steps in the submission instructions to push your changes to the Git repository.


NOTE: students who still chooses to use the remote connection are free to do so.

## IDE Without using Git
You can also choose to directly upload your file after coding. Find the following on your git repository.

## Cloning Instructions

1. After successful remote connection, go to SDRIVE->CS1580 directory
   > ``cd SDRIVE\CS1580``
   * Or wherever you created your original CS1580 folder.
2. Clone the assigned repository 
   > ``git clone <repo_url>``
3. Change directory to cloned repo
   > ``cd 2023-SP-A-lab0x-abcdef``
4. Start coding
   > ``nano <filename>.cpp``

## Submission Instructions
1. To git-classes
    - Save your code to your repo and submit every file in the folder - 
  
        > ``git add .``

    - Commit changes

        > ``git commit -m "<your_message>"``

    - Push to repo
  
        > ``git push``

If git-classes is not available to you, submit your code to canvas as needed.

***Screenshots of your code running is not sufficient for lab credit. You must submit your source code.***
